              <p> We are TAL Company, a real estate company that has been in the property management business for over two decades now. We own buildings across the upper west side in New York and have managed to expand to Florida. We take pride in running a straight forward and fair business with our clients. Always maintaining communication and proving our loyalty. We appreciate all business, feel free to <a href="contact.html" class="contactusp">contact us</a>.</p>

                  <h2>Interested In An Apartment?</h2>
                  <p>If you find an apartment that you are interested in then feel free to <a href="contact.html" class="contactusp">message us</a> to schedule a time to visit the property. We also provide an option for a virtual tour or additional photo's/videos of any apartment.</p>

                  <h2>How To Rent From Us?</h2>
                  <p> If you do not feel the need to visit the apartment and want to get straight into the rental process you may do so by <a href="contact.html" class="contactusp">contacting us</a> regarding which apartment you are interested in and we will send you back an apartment rental form. This form will ask various questions regarding you in order to make sure you qualify.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="service-item">
                  <h2>What's Needed To Qualify For An Apartment?</h2>
                  <p>Qualifying for one of our apartments is relatively simple. The main factor of whether or not you will receive the apartment relies on your credit score and your past ability to pay dues that you’ve owed. If you do not have a credit score that is no problem! However, in that situation you would need to find someone who does have one and they have to sign as your guarantor. By doing so, they are signing that they take responsibility and the fall in a situation where you don’t pay or cause damage to the property.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="service-item">
                  <h2>Additional Fee's</h2>
                  <p>Since you will be directly renting from us, you will not need to pay any broker fees. There will be no monthly fees that are additional to your payment of rent. The only additional fee that you might have to pay will be for a credit check which usually ranges between a one time payment of $30-$50. </p>
